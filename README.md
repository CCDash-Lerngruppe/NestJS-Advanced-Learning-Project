# NestJS Advanced Learning Project

Welcome to the **NestJS Advanced Learning Project**! This repository provides a comprehensive guide and practical exercises for mastering advanced concepts in NestJS, including Domain-Driven Design (DDD), CQRS, Event Sourcing, Testing, CI/CD, and modern architectural patterns.

## Project Goals

The purpose of this project is to enable developers to:

- **Understand Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Model complex business domains effectively and structure applications around business logic.
- **Implement CQRS and Event Sourcing:** Separate read and write operations, and use event-based persistence for scalability and historical data reconstruction.
- **Enhance Code Quality:** Write robust tests, implement CI/CD pipelines, and follow SOLID principles.
- **Adopt Modern Architectures:** Apply hexagonal and clean architecture patterns for maintainable, scalable, and robust software design.

---

## Features

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- Learn to define **Bounded Contexts** and **Ubiquitous Language**.
- Model your business logic around domain-driven services and entities.
- Utilize NestJS modules to separate and encapsulate specific domains.

### 2. CQRS and Event Sourcing

- Implement **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** for read/write separation.
- Use **Event Sourcing** to maintain a complete history of domain events.
- Explore event-driven communication between modules and services.

### 3. Advanced Testing and CI/CD

- Write Unit, Integration, and End-to-End tests for all critical features.
- Automate tests using tools like Jest and the NestJS Testing module.
- Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment workflows using GitHub Actions or similar tools.

### 4. Architecture Patterns and Best Practices

- Understand and apply **SOLID principles** for cleaner and maintainable code.
- Explore **Hexagonal Architecture** and **Clean Architecture** for domain-focused development.
- Separate core domain logic from infrastructure concerns like persistence or external APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js (v14 or later) installed.
- **NestJS CLI:** Install NestJS CLI globally using `npm install -g @nestjs/cli`.
- **Database:** A running instance of PostgreSQL or a similar database for persistence.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nestJSLernen.git
   cd nestJSLernen
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database connection:
   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials.
   - Ensure the database is running and accessible.
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

### Usage

- Access the API documentation at `http://localhost:3000/api`.
- Interact with GraphQL at `http://localhost:3000/graphql`.

## Exercises

This project includes practical exercises for each advanced concept:

1. **Domain-Driven Design:**
   - Identify bounded contexts.
   - Implement services and modules for each context.

2. **CQRS and Event Sourcing:**
   - Create Command and Query handlers for specific operations.
   - Implement a simple event store for persisting and replaying domain events.

3. **Testing and CI/CD:**
   - Write unit and integration tests for services and controllers.
   - Configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

4. **Architectural Review:**
   - Refactor an existing module to adhere to hexagonal architecture principles.
   - Document your architecture decisions and ensure proper separation of concerns.

---

## Best Practices

- Use **Validation Pipes** for request validation.
- Implement **Exception Filters** for standardized error handling.
- Follow **SOLID principles** and ensure clear separation of responsibilities.
- Use **Event Emitters** or Message Brokers for inter-service communication in a microservice setup.
